# Overview of Repository: Algorithms and Data Structures in C++

This repository contains implementations of fundamental algorithms and data structures in C++. Each program is designed to illustrate key concepts such as linked lists, stacks, queues, binary search trees, and graph algorithms. Below is a brief summary of each program:

## 1. Linked List Operations
**File:** 
[`Singly Linked list`](https://github.com/rewyekha/Data-Structure-using-CPP/blob/4b5bab210e662da0237731430b5cba1b7d3e1272/Singly%20Linked%20List.CPP)
[`Double Linked list`](https://github.com/rewyekha/Data-Structure-using-CPP/blob/4b5bab210e662da0237731430b5cba1b7d3e1272/Doubly%20linked%20list.CPP)

**Description:** Implements basic operations on a singly linked list including insertion, deletion, and display.

## 2. Stack Operations using Array
**File:** 
[`Student marklist using array`](https://github.com/rewyekha/Data-Structure-using-CPP/blob/4b5bab210e662da0237731430b5cba1b7d3e1272/std%20marklist%20using%20array.cpp)
**Description:** Implements stack operations (push, pop, display) using an array-based implementation.

## 3. Queue Operations using Pointers
**File:** 
[`Queue using pointers`](https://github.com/rewyekha/Data-Structure-using-CPP/blob/4b5bab210e662da0237731430b5cba1b7d3e1272/queue%20using%20pointers.cpp)

**Description:** Implements queue operations (insertion, deletion, display) using pointers.

## 4. Evaluation of Prefix and Postfix Expressions
**File:** 
[`Expressions`](https://github.com/rewyekha/Data-Structure-using-CPP/blob/4b5bab210e662da0237731430b5cba1b7d3e1272/Expressions.cpp)
**Description:** Evaluates prefix and postfix expressions using stack data structure for arithmetic operations.

## 5. Binary Search Tree Traversal
**File:** 
[`Binary search tree`](https://github.com/rewyekha/Data-Structure-using-CPP/blob/4b5bab210e662da0237731430b5cba1b7d3e1272/Binary%20Search%20Trees.cpp)
**Description:** Implements binary search tree operations including insertion, deletion, and three types of traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder).

## 6. Graph Representation using Adjacency List
**File:** 
[`Tree Traversals`](https://github.com/rewyekha/Data-Structure-using-CPP/blob/4b5bab210e662da0237731430b5cba1b7d3e1272/traversals%20using%20recursion.CPP)
**Description:** Represents an undirected graph using adjacency list and provides basic operations to add edges and display the graph.

## 7. Shortest Path using Dijkstra's Algorithm
**File:** 
[`Dijkstra's Algorithm`](https://github.com/rewyekha/Data-Structure-using-CPP/blob/4b5bab210e662da0237731430b5cba1b7d3e1272/Shortest%20distance%20%5Busing%20Dijikstra%E2%80%99s%20algorithm%5D.CPP)
**Description:** Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from a specified starting node to all other nodes in a weighted graph represented using adjacency list.


## Getting Started

To compile and run these programs, ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your system (such as g++ for Linux or MinGW for Windows). You can compile each program individually by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
g++ ProgramFileName.cpp -o ProgramFileName

```
